# Bubble-game

Bubble-game is a popular and simple website game. All you have to do is set up a minimum of five bubbles with the same color in horizontal, vertical, or bias format -then, those bubbles disappear. Every time you set up a bubble you will have new three bubbles on your board. You get as many points as many bubbles disappear. You can move a bubble only if it has an open road. Bubble-game ends if you don't have where to move. Enjoy!

This is my first bigger project that only uses javascript, some HTML, and css.  The main goal was to improve my javascript skills.
